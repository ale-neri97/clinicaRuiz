<h1 id="contributingtothephplibraryformongodb">Contributing to the PHP Library for MongoDB</h1>

<h2 id="initializingtherepository">Initializing the Repository</h2>

<p>Developers who would like to contribute to the library will need to clone it and
initialize the project dependencies with <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library.git
$ cd mongo-php-library
$ composer update
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to installing project dependencies, Composer will check that the
required extension version is installed. Directions for installing the extension
may be found <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Installation directions for Composer may be found in its
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md">Getting Started</a> guide.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>The library&#8217;s test suite uses <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, which should be
installed as a development dependency by Composer.</p>

<p>The test suite may be executed with:</p>

<pre><code>$ vendor/bin/phpunit
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>phpunit.xml.dist</code> file is used as the default configuration file for the
test suite. In addition to various PHPUnit options, it defines required
<code>MONGODB_URI</code> and <code>MONGODB_DATABASE</code> environment variables. You may customize
this configuration by creating your own <code>phpunit.xml</code> file based on the
<code>phpunit.xml.dist</code> file we provide.</p>

<h2 id="checkingcodingstandards">Checking coding standards</h2>

<p>The library&#8217;s code is checked using <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP_CodeSniffer</a>,
which is installed as a development dependency by Composer. Due to the PHP
requirement, the base version of the coding standard is not installed and needs
to be added manually if you plan to contributing code:</p>

<pre><code>$ composer require --dev doctrine/coding-standard=^6.0
</code></pre>

<p>Once the coding standard has been installed, you can check the code for style
errors:</p>

<pre><code>$ vendor/bin/phpcs
</code></pre>

<p>To automatically fix all fixable errors, use the <code>phpcbf</code> binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ vendor/bin/phpcbf
</code></pre>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation for the library lives in the <code>docs/</code> directory and is built with
tools in the related
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/docs-php-library">mongodb/docs-php-library</a>
repository. The tools repository is already configured to reference our sources.</p>

<p>That said, any changes to the documentation should be tested locally before
committing. Follow the following steps to build the docs locally with the tools
repository:</p>

<ul>
<li> Clone the
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/docs-php-library">mongodb/docs-php-library</a> tools
repository.</li>
<li> Install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/giza/">giza</a>, as noted in the tools
README.</li>
<li> Sync your working copy of the documentation to the <code>source/</code> directory with
<code>rsync -a --delete /path/to/mongo-php-library/docs/ source/</code>.</li>
<li> Build the documentation with <code>giza make publish</code>. You can suppress
informational log messages with the <code>--level warning</code> option.</li>
<li> Generated documentation may be found in the <code>build/master/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="releasing">Releasing</h2>

<p>The follow steps outline the release process for a maintenance branch (e.g.
releasing the <code>vX.Y</code> branch as X.Y.Z).</p>

<h3 id="ensurephpversioncompatibility">Ensure PHP version compatibility</h3>

<p>Ensure that the library test suite completes on supported versions of PHP.</p>

<h3 id="transitionjiraissuesandversion">Transition JIRA issues and version</h3>

<p>All issues associated with the release version should be in the &#8220;Closed&#8221; state
and have a resolution of &#8220;Fixed&#8221;. Issues with other resolutions (e.g.
&#8220;Duplicate&#8221;, &#8220;Works as Designed&#8221;) should be removed from the release version so
that they do not appear in the release notes.</p>

<p>Check the corresponding &#8220;.x&#8221; fix version to see if it contains any issues that
are resolved as &#8220;Fixed&#8221; and should be included in this release version.</p>

<p>Update the version&#8217;s release date and status from the
<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/PHPLIB/versions">Manage Versions</a>
page.</p>

<h3 id="updateversioninfo">Update version info</h3>

<p>The PHP library uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. Do not break
backwards compatibility in a non-major release or your users will kill you.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, ensure that the <code>master</code> branch is up-to-date with all code
changes in this maintenance branch. This is important because we will later
merge the ensuing release commits up to master with <code>--strategy=ours</code>, which
will ignore changes from the merged commits.</p>

<h3 id="tagrelease">Tag release</h3>

<p>The maintenance branch&#8217;s HEAD will be the target for our release tag:</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -a -m &quot;Release X.Y.Z&quot; X.Y.Z
</code></pre>

<h3 id="pushtags">Push tags</h3>

<pre><code>$ git push --tags
</code></pre>

<h3 id="mergethemaintenancebranchuptomaster">Merge the maintenance branch up to master</h3>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge vX.Y --strategy=ours
$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--strategy=ours</code> option ensures that all changes from the merged commits
will be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="publishreleasenotes">Publish release notes</h3>

<p>The following template should be used for creating GitHub release notes via
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/releases/new">this form</a>.</p>

<pre><code>The PHP team is happy to announce that version X.Y.Z of the MongoDB PHP library is now available. This library is a high-level abstraction for the [`mongodb`](http://php.net/mongodb) extension.
