<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I encountered an issue with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="php">echo Carbon::parse('2018-06-01')-&gt;subDay()-&gt;month;
</code></pre>

<p>Carbon version: <strong>PUT HERE YOUR CARBON VERSION (exact version, not the range)</strong></p>

<p>PHP version: <strong>PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION</strong></p>

<!--
    Run the command `composer show nesbot/carbon`
    to get "versions"
    Use `echo phpversion();`
    to get PHP version.

    Some issues can depends on your context, settings,
    macros, timezone, language. So to be sure the code
    you give is enough to reproduce your bug, try it

    the [Export] button, copy the link of the opened tab,

<p>I expected to get:</p>

<pre><code>6
</code></pre>

<!--
    Always give your expectations. Each use has their owns.
    You may want daylight saving time to be taken into account,
    someone else want it to be ignored. You may want timezone
    to be used in comparisons, someone else may not, etc.
-->

<p>But I actually get:</p>

<pre><code>5
</code></pre>

<!--
    If you did not succeed to get the same result in

    result you get.
